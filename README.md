I'm a structural engineer turned software engineer who is just trying to make the world a better place. I now work in the defense industry, building primarily desktop/mobile apps and developer tools. 

Happily employed @ Integration Innovation, Inc (AKA i3) - **no employment solicitations, please.**

 <summary><strong>Ask me about:</strong></summary>
  
  * .NET application development (C#/F#),
  * automated testing in .NET,
  * project management (Scrum and Kanban are my jams),
  * working in the aerospace and defense industry,
  * TypeScript,
  * podcast recommendations,
  * fun recipes (I throw down on Mexican, Greek, and Indian cuisine)


</details>

I'm currently working to improve my CI/CD skills, as well as (slowly) chipping away at the backlog of personal projects I entertain. Along with C#/F#/TS, I like to dabble in Python (and Matlab, when time allows it).

My work utilizes non-GitHub resources, so I may not be super responsive if you try to interact with me here. If you need my attention, my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_jdcook3) is the best way to reach me online (or find me in one of many programming discord servers).

I'm open to collaborate/participate on any .NET project you might have! I have quite a lot of interest areas, so you're unlikely to be working on something that I'm not at least down to give code reviews/commits to - feel free to reach out with anything!
