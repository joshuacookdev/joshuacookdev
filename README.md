I'm a structural engineer turned software engineer who is trying to make the world a better place. I now focus on building software for the defense and public health industries. 

_Very_ happily employed @ [TactWare](https://tactware.net).

  * How we can make the world better together,

  * Software and Systems Architecture,
  * .NET development - desktop, mobile, _testing_,
  * Kotlin development

I'm currently working across lots of platforms - C# w/ MAUI & Avalonia, C++ & Ada (yes, really), and (some) Kotlin for work, so you're likely to see work in that space when I'm active here. I'm also working to (slowly) chip away at the backlog of personal projects I entertain. I have a strong background in software architecture and security practices (RMF is a blast 🙂), and enjoy dabbling in Swift when time allows.

My work utilizes non-GitHub resources, so I may not be _super_ responsive if you try to interact with me here. If you need my attention immediately, my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jdcook3/) is the best way to reach me online (or find me in one of many programming discord servers).
