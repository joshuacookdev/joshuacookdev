### Hi, I'm Joshua!

I'm a civil/structural engineer turned software tester and developer - I primarily work in the .NET world, but enjoy the infrequent foray into other stacks. Happily employed - **no employment solicitations, please.**

I'm currently working to fill out my CI/CD skills, as well as (slowly) poking away at a long backlog of personal pet projects. My job utilizes the Atlassian suite, so my work here will ebb and flow - I primarily use GitHub for interacting and training new devs on our contracts, and leading them through personal projects. If *you* would also like some assistance or a code review, please feel free to reach out - I'm always happy to help others get started!

Ask me about C# desktop/mobile app development, Windows UI Testing, XUnit/NUnit/MSTest, Project Management (Scrum and Kanban are my jams), my hot takes on what C# and .NET are coming up with, podcast recommendations, and recipes (if you don't want to talk shop). I'll likely ask back about whatever knowledge-gap that Pluralsight showed me that I'm currently working on (I have more than I thought!).

I'm looking to collaborate with pretty much anyone, on any project (1+ for .NET) - like I said earlier, feel free to reach out. I'm interested in a plethora of fields, so you'll be unlikely to be working on something that I'm not at least down to give you code reviews, if not work issues for/with you and your project.

Pronouns/Nouns: he/him/his/"hey you"/Cook - anything but "Josh" (no offense to any Josh's out there - you guys are great)

Fun fact: I play a dozen stringed instruments, have a 5 year old Aussie, and am planning to get married Spring of '21 (COVID willing).
