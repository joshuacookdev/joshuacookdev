I'm a structural engineer turned software tester and developer. I work in the defense industry, building primarily desktop apps and developer tools. Happily employed @ SAIC - **no employment solicitations, please.**

Ask me about:
* .NET development (C#/F#),
* automated testing in .NET,
* project management (Scrum and Kanban are my jams),
* working in the space and defense industry,
* TypeScript,
* podcast recommendations,
* fun recipes

I'm currently working to improve my CI/CD skills, as well as (slowly) chipping away at the backlog of personal projects I entertain. Along with C#/F#/TS, I like to dabble in Python (and Matlab, when time allows it).

My work utilizes the Atlassian suite, so I may not be super responsive if you try to interact with me here. If you need my attention, my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_jdcook3) is the best way to reach me.

A little more about me:
* Preferred (pro)nouns: Joshua/he/him/"hey you"/Cook
* Avid tutorial taker
* Live for music, both listening and making
* Married
* Puppy dad
* Conservationist
* Fly fisherman

I'm open to collaborate/participate on any .NET project you might have! I have quite a lot of interest areas, so you're unlikely to be working on something that I'm not at least down to give code reviews/commits to - feel free to reach out with anything!
