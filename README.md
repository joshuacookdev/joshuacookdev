I'm a structural engineer turned software tester and developer. I work in the defense industry, building primarily desktop apps and developer tools. Happily employed @ SAIC - **no employment solicitations, please.**

  * .NET application development (C#/F#),
  * automated testing in .NET,
  * project management (Scrum and Kanban are my jams),
  * working in the space and defense industry,
  * TypeScript,
  * podcast recommendations,
  * fun recipes


</details>

I'm currently working to improve my CI/CD skills, as well as (slowly) chipping away at the backlog of personal projects I entertain. Along with C#/F#/TS, I like to dabble in Python (and Matlab, when time allows it).

My work utilizes the Atlassian suite, so I may not be super responsive if you try to interact with me here. If you need my attention, my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_jdcook3) is the best way to reach me.

I'm open to collaborate/participate on any .NET project you might have! I have quite a lot of interest areas, so you're unlikely to be working on something that I'm not at least down to give code reviews/commits to - feel free to reach out with anything!
