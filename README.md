I'm a structural engineer turned software engineer who is trying to make the world a better place. I now focus on building software for the defense and public health industries. 

_Very_ happily employed @ Integration Innovation, Inc (AKA i3).

I'm currently working across Android/Kotlin, React/TS, and MAUI/C# for work, so you're likely to see those techs here when I work on OSS. I'm also working to (slowly) chip away at the backlog of personal projects I entertain. I have a strong background in the .NET ecosystem, and enjoy dabbling in Swift (iOS) & Lua (gaming) when time allows.

My work utilizes non-GitHub resources, so I may not be _super_ responsive if you try to interact with me here. If you need my attention, my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_jdcook3) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jdcook3/) is the best way to reach me online (or find me in one of many programming discord servers).
