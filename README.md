### Hi, I'm Joshua!

I'm a civil/structural engineer turned software tester and developer - I primarily work in the .NET world, building primarily desktop apps and tools. Happily employed - **no employment solicitations, please.**

I'm currently working to fill out my CI/CD skills, as well as (slowly) poking away at a long backlog of personal pet projects. My job utilizes the Atlassian suite, so my work here will ebb and flow - I primarily use GitHub for interacting and training new devs on our contracts, and leading them through personal projects. If *you* would also like some assistance or a code review, please feel free to reach out - I'm always happy to help others get started!

  * C# desktop/mobile app development, 
  * Windows UI Testing, XUnit/NUnit/MSTest, 
  * Project Management (Scrum and Kanban are my jams), 
  * my hot takes on what C# and .NET are rolling out, 
  * podcast recommendations,
  * even fun recipes (if you don't want to talk shop).

I'm looking to collaborate on any .NET project you might have - like I said earlier, feel free to reach out with anything. You're unlikely to be working on something that I'm not at least down to give you code reviews, if not work issues for/with you and your project.

Pronouns/Nouns: he/him/his/"hey you"/Cook - anything but "Josh" (no offense to any Josh's out there - you guys are great)

Fun fact: I play a dozen stringed instruments, have a 5 year old Aussie, and am planning to get married Spring of '21 (COVID willing).
